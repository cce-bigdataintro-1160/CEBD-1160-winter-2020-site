## Evaluation
* Project (40%)
  - Feasibility (5%)
  - Planning (15%)
  - Execution (20%)

* Homework (50%)

### Expectations
 - Homework and Journals will be due before the start of  the following class
 - Students must get at least a 50% grade in each component of the course
 - Everybody has 2 late days which can be used on homework, but not the project

### Project 
* Solve a real-world problem using data science techniques

* Over the course of the term, we will:
  - Choose a dataset & question you want to answer
  - Create a plan towards a solution
  - Answer the question
  
* [scikitlearn Toy Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets)

### Journaling
  - Provide me with feedback
  - Self-reflect on your progress
  - Appreciate the hard work youâ€™re putting in
  - Communicate your expectations

### Homework
- Each class we will come up with 3 tasks, worth a  total of 10 points:
  1.	Basic (6/10) This will require the application of what we did in class
  2.  Advanced (3/10) This will require the extension of what we did in class
  3.	Reach (1/10) This will be a difficult task that uses what we learned in class
