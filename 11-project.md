# Final Project
* [Final project instructions/template](https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/cebd1160_project_template)
* [Final project example](https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/cebd1160_project_template/tree/gkexample)

* You may use the template structure to guide your thinking, but don't feel constrained by it, add and modify sections as you see fit
* Back your claims using plots and data obtained using your dataset analysis skills
* Make sure to add references for libraries and methods you're using  
* You can look for other people that "solved" your dataset on Google. You might find many ideas that you hadn't thought of!
* The objective will be to both start your data skills portfolio and also exercise your data presenting(and storytelling) skills! 
* Use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) formatting to make your project look good, by creating sections and embedding pictures.

* FAQ
  * Can I change my originally chosen dataset?
    
    Yes!

  * Can I change my originally chosen question?
    
    Yes too!

  * Is it mandatory to make a final project?
    Yesss! Presenting results and storytelling is a very important skill in Big Data and any successful career in tech!

  * How should I present my final project?
    
    Sky is the limit! You'll have ~5-10 minutes to present to everyone in the class your data project. You can use the readme.md GitHub page, a power point presentation or whatever means you prefer (that you know is installed in class)

  * Can I change the csv dataset instead of the sklearn one?
    
    Yes, but take the risks into account, they haven't been 'prepared'!

  * How many plots should I add to my project?
    
    There isn't really a limit, try to stick with the "best" ones in order to explain each section of your template!

  * How do I format/style my project to look as good as the sample project?
    
    Look at the raw version of it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/cebd1160_project_template/gkexample/README.md)!!!

  * Is there a specific algorithm I should use?
    
    You can use as many algorithms as you want and you can compare their results. You can try to optimize your score using feature selection or any other techniques you might find interesting!

  * I'm really stuck! I don't know exactly if my question is good or how to solve it...
    
    Google for inspiration! The reasons those datasets were chosen is because they've been largely used in Machine Learning literature. This means you'll find awesome inspiration around the internet, which I recommend you read and understand thoroughly to help you!
    Some other ideas you can use to improve your project: 
    * compare different algorithms and hyperparameters to find out what are the best solutions for your problem
    * analyze some discrepancy in your data (for example, if you expected some feature to have high impact on your prediction, but it doesn't, you could analyze what's the cause of that)
    * optimize what's the combination of features that can lead you to the best performance
    * transform your dataset to enrich it during the preparation phase
    * challenge your own results and question with other data (maybe even external data)

  * How will the grade be calculated:
    * 20% Visualization Code	
    * 20% Data Exploration Code	
    * 15% Machine Learning Code	
    * 20% ReadMe Description	
    * 25% In Class Presentation
