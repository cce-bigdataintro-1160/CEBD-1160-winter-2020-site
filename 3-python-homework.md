Here's the homework for our third class!!! Due to the holiday I've added some extra content to keep you engaged on the Python learning, try to use PyCharm/Python Shell as much as possible to do the exercises!!!

*Basic*

1. Be a `git` master! That is, do the following *from scratch*:
  * create a new repository on Github called `git-homework`, with a license and a readme.md file
  * clone it locally
  * create a new text file that contains at least 1 line of text
  * add your file to the repository
  * commit your changes
  * edit the README.MD file that came in the repo in some way
  * commit your changes in a separate commit
  * push your changes to Github
  * send me the url for your Github repository

2. Read the following text about Markdown, a markup language used to format the README page on GitHub.
