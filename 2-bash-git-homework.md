*Basic*
1 - Install the Python 3.7 Language on your computer:
- *Instructions for Linux*: If using Linux (Ubuntu), you probably don't need to install it as most distributions have it by default. Here are the instructions if you still need to for some reason: https://realpython.com/installing-python/#linux

- *Instructions for Mac*: https://realpython.com/installing-python/#macos-mac-os-x . If you prefer to do it "from scratch" you can use this guide : https://www.python.org/downloads/ but it requires more OS technical knowledge.

- *Instructions for Windows*: I strongly recommend using Anaconda (a Data Science Platform that already has Python installed) from : https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. If you prefer to do it "from scratch" you can use this guide : https://realpython.com/installing-python/#windows but it requires more OS technical knowledge.

2 - Install PyCharm Community Edition on your computer, this will be our main editor to work with Python for now and it's available for all operating systems: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
Feel free to open the tool and explore it a bit, but next class we'll dedicate some time to get familiar with it.
