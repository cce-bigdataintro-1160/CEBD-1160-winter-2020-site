# Intro 2 Linux

### Objectives
* A brief introduction to OS and Linux
* Learn what's the shell
* Be able to Navigate through the file system
* Work with Files and Directories

### A brief introduction to OS and Linux
* [Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system): An operating system provides facilities to interface between applications and hardware using low level libraries and drivers.
* The most important resources it will manage are:
  * Inputs: Mouse, Keyboard, Sensors, Network
  * Outputs: UI, Disk, Network 
  * Processing (or In-Memory) state: Applications, scripts, programs
  * Storage (or Persistent) state: File systems/Disk
  
* Big Data Software will try to leverage these resources to work in a coordinated and distributed way across many nodes
* [Awesome Big Data](https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-bigdata): In this link we have an exhaustive list of Big Data open software. Most of it was built to run on Linux distributions only.
* [Cloudera Open Source](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop/key-cdh-components.html) Another list, now composed of Cloudera's open source software for Big Data, also meant to be run on Linux platform.
* [The Linux Ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix#/media/File:Unix_history-simple.svg): An image describing where Linux comes from
* [Linux list of distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions): A description of existing Linux distributions. The most widely used are Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS(RedHat)

### Learn what's the shell
* Bash is an implementation of a shell: a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions.

* [The shell](./bash-git-files/shell.png): An image depicting the utility of the shell, interfacing inputs and outputs towards the kernel(core) of Linux
* [Bash, the Unix Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)): A wikipedia page on the most popular Linux shell

### Be able to Navigate through the file system
* We'll now learn the basics in order to navigate in a file system

![](bash-git-files/fshierarchy.png)

* [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard - Linux Standard Directories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard): The basic file system organization in Linux
* [Navigation shell commands](https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/CEBD-1160-fall-2019-code/blob/master/class2-notebook/2-navigation_shell_commands.sh)
* [The man command - manual](http://www.linfo.org/man.html): A utilitary tool to read the manual for any shell command

* Do the following exercise in pairs:
1. Find out what's your username. Find your home directory and list its contents.
2. Change directory to `/` and list the contents of this directory. Why is this a special directory?
3. Change directory to `/var/log` and list its files. What do we have here?
4. From the previous dir `/var/log` type `cd ../../Users/<myusername>`, why is the new current directory special?
5. Test the following commands: `cd .`, `cd ..`, `cd /` and  `cd ~`. Can you explain what each of those symbols mean?
6. From your home directory test both commands and explain the difference: `cd Desktop` and `cd /Desktop`
7. What command can give you the most recently modified file in your home directory? Hint, use `man ls` to find the right flags to use.
8. Download the file titanic.zip from Slack using the UI and locate it through the Terminal by navigating and listing it. Tip: it will be in your Downloads directory, inside the your home directory.

### Work with Files and Directories
* Let's spend some time getting to know the most basic file operations we can do on a file system.
* [Working with files](https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/CEBD-1160-fall-2019-code/blob/master/class2-notebook/3-files_dirs_shell_commands.sh)

* Do the following exercise in pairs:
1. Create a directory called `learning-shell` in your home directory
2. Download the file `random-datasets` from Slack
3. Copy it from your `~/Downloads` directory into your `learning-shell` directory
4. Unzip it using `unzip random-datasets.zip`
5. Look at those files contents by printing some files in your directories using `cat` or `less`
6. Lets organize this by first moving all files that start with `construction-spending` into the directory `construction-data`
7. Rename `Iris.csv` into `Iris_Classification.csv` and move it into `iris-species`
8. Delete the `capital.json` file.
9. Delete the `delete-me` directory.
10. Create two new directories: `csv` and `mixed`
11. Move the `construction-data` directory into the `mixed` directory
12. Move the heart.csv file in `csv`
13. Let's backup our whole directory `learning-shell` by copying it to the `~/Desktop` directory
14. Check all of your changes using the UI
15. Create a file (using `vi` or `nano` editors) called `a_dataset.csv` in your home directory, write a few `csv` lines in it and save it.

### Final notes on Linux and Shell
* Let's review what we've learned today
* The concepts we learned today apply for pretty much any filesystem, including the ones used for Big Data like HDFS, S3, GCS and AS
* Manipulating data in shell can save you a lot of time as those tools tend to be extremely lightweight
* A few real life use cases for using the shell to deal with data are:
  - organization (mv, rm, cp, split)
  - exploration (wc, grep, find, ls, cat)
  - cleaning (cut, uniq, sort)
  - validation and detecting corrupted files (head, tail, md5, wc)
  - maintenance and capture using a cron scheduler (cron, curl, wget)
  - cleanup and backup (cp, rm)
* Mastering the shell is essential if you want to engage in a Big Data Devops / Dataops career! Most tools installation, maintenance and troubleshooting will require understanding of these concepts.
