As always, don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal @ https://forms.gle/QAe9Dm54xNwUxZqZA !!!!

Here's the homework for this week:

*PREPARATION*
Create a new repository on GitHub called viz-homework and clone it locally.
Use this repository to push all the scripts for this week's homework. Send me the link your repository after you are done!

# Basic
1. Basic: Create a python script(any name) and your project dataset to regenerate a ton of figures (20+) showing data with at least *3* features at a time, leveraging things like:
* multiple plots on the same figure
* multiple plots on the same axes
* colours, markers, sizes, shapes, hue, etc...
* 3D visualizations
* use any library you want!

 You can determine how you choose these columns based on conceptual understanding of your dataset, or generating all possible combinations! Push your script and make sure the figures have titles, axis labels, and legends if applicable. (Pushing the images is optional, I recommend pushing the most interesting ones at least)

# Advanced
1. from all your figures, tell me the *greatest* one for interpreting your data, and justify why by explicitly comparing it to some other figures! Write which figure, why and your comparison on your README.MD file.

# Reach
1. Read the following link in preparation for next week: http://scipy-lectures.org/packages/scikit-learn/index.html#introduction-problem-settings
In particular, sections `3.6.1` to `3.6.5`. Don’t worry if this is a bit “over your head” right now - it’ll really vary based on your math background and we'll be going through these concepts in the next class. Send me a message acknowledging you finished this part.
2. (Optional) Do the Seaborn exercises from the class https://cce-bigdataintro-1160.github.io/CEBD-1160-fall-2019-site/7-viz.html

Don't forget to check at the reference codes we saw in the class to help you do the https://github.com/cce-bigdataintro-1160/CEBD-1160-fall-2019-code/tree/master/5-python-dataviz-notebook :book:

And don't hesitate if you have questions! Next class we start on data Machine Learning!:brain::robot_face:
