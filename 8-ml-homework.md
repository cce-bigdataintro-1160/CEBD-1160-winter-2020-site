Thanks again for the excellent class, I hope you enjoyed it as much as me :slightly_smiling_face: And here's the homework for next week:
### Homework
* Don't forget to fill up the Weekly Journal! https://forms.gle/QAe9Dm54xNwUxZqZA

##### Basic
1. "refactor" your plotting code to work on the dataset as loaded by `from sklearn.datasets import load_{yourdatasetname}`
2. perform classification/regression (for the question you asked in the first week) on your dataset using Linear regression/Logistic regression, as applicable, and print performance

##### Advanced
1. perform classification/regression (for the question you asked in the first week) on your dataset using KNeighborsClassifier or KNeighborsRegressor, as applicable, and print the performance. This can be done through the instructions in [scipy lectures for scikit-learn](http://scipy-lectures.org/packages/scikit-learn/index.html#introduction-problem-settings)
2. test the perfomance of your model using different values for the parameter `n_neighbors`

##### Reach
1. use 1+ other types of classifier/regressors in scikit-learn for answering your question. (check the section `About choosing the best algorithms` https://cce-bigdataintro-1160.github.io/CEBD-1160-fall-2019-site/8-ml.html for ideas)
2. using comments, describe the classifiers/regressors you're using (that'd be to do a very short research on how the algorithms you're using works)

Dont hesitate to send questions in channel and have a great week!

As a side assignment please also install docker on your computer. I believe it will be straightforward for some people, but as some other will find it challenging, we'll start installing it this week. Here are the instructions:

Windows 7 or Windows 10 Home: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

Windows 7 or Windows 10 Pro: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
