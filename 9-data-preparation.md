# Data Preparation

### Agenda
* Pandas DataFrames manipulation, cleanup and preparation
* Data cleanup and preparation for sklearn
* Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
* Where do I go from here?
* Final Project

### Data preparation
Goal for today will be to review everything we learned so far, play with data preparation and kickoff the final project development!

### Pandas DataFrames manipulation, cleanup and preparation
* Let's check a few new DataFrame operations:
  * Concatenating DataFrames
  * Renaming columns
  * Replacing values
  * Mapping values

### Data cleanup and preparation for sklearn
* An overview of some important data preparation techniques:
  * Filling up missing data
  * Encoding categorical features with dummy variables
  * Producing numerical data from textual data
  * Dropping columns with small impact or that add 'noise' (not really correlated)
* This way we should have only numerical values for sklearn

### Where do I go from here?
* Well, this will depend a lot on where do you want to go :)
* A few more guided exercises to warmup: [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)
* A good starting point to develop ML skills: [Kaggle Getting Started Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=grouped&group=general&page=1&pageSize=20&category=gettingStarted)
* A more advanced challenge with unprocessed data [Montreal Open Data](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/)
* [Other Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
* Study other Computer Science topics like web development and microservices in order to deploy ML models
* [CCE Big Data Diploma](https://www.concordia.ca/cce/programs/big-data.html)
